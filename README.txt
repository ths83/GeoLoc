# GeoLoc
Informatic master Android Project first yeardone with classmate, University of Toulon 2015-2016

This project was done with a classmate.
The objective was to details it with personal specifications, which are present here.
We also needs to do UML, to modelize and describe more specifically the application.

The need of GeoLoc is to permit connection and sign up, done with Parse.com database solution.
Once connected, you can create an excursion, which permit to choose map type, you can place marker to choose your itinerary,
and your color route depends on altitude current user.

Some informations are also available (distance, current speed...).

Unfortunately, we haven't time to finish it, we haven't done the possibility to join an excursion.

You can test it, a .apk is present.

Enjoy !!!
